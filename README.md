# Good Pop, Bad Pop VR

My submission for the fourth Godot XR game jam (https://itch.io/jam/godot-xr-game-jam-sep-2025).

## About this game

Looks like these kids are up to no good again. Chief of Police Mom needs you to question the suspects in a series of tough who-dun-it cases and get to the bottom of these mysteries. But you won't be able to do it without using a few tricks from the old dad playbook.

Act as the Good Pop to sooth your suspect if they start feeling too anxious or scared. You want to keep them calm and happy if you expect to get any useful information out of them.

Or act as the Bad Pop if you think your suspect isn't telling you everything. Sometimes a stern talking to can scare them straight. But be careful, go too far and they'll be asking for Lawyer Mommy to help them out.
